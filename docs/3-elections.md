# Elections

Some positions in the game are elected by members of organizations.

Example:

The Casmir Thain is the leader of Casmir, a quite democratic State. Casmir, an organization, has the power to convoke elections to the Casmir Thain position. The members of Casmir can present their candidacy to the Casmir Thain position and they can also vote in the election.

## Powers

The following powers are relevant to elections:

 - Convoking elections
 - Present candidacy
 - Elect

## The process

Starting elections may happen in two ways:

 - Automatically after a preriod of time. This depends on wether the position subject to elections has automatic elections configured.
 - Manually by trigering the "convoke elections" power.

The incumbent holder of the position automatically presents a candidacy.

Once elections are started, they last for between 6 and 18 monts. Up to three months before the elections, anyone with the "present candidacy" power may present themselves to the elections, change their candidacy or retire it.

When less than three months are remaining to the elections, candidacies are "frozen" and cannot presented, changed or retired.

## Resolving and ties

When the month of the election ends, the election resolves. The candidate with most votes wins and occupies the position.

There are some special cases:

 - If there is only a single candidacy with zero votes, it is declared a winner.
 - No candidacies are presented. In that case, a new election starts that will resolve in 6 months.
 - There is a tie. The incumbent position holder stays, even if they lost. A new election starts that will resolve in 6 months.
