<p>
    In Finem Imperii you can create up to 3 characters in fictional
    open worlds. Each character will start in a "country" of your choice.

<h5>
    Turns and time
</h5>

<p>
    Your character will start with 15 days available to spend in whichever
    actions you choose. Some actions will cost little or no time,
    while other may cost most of the time your character has.
</p>

<p>
    Each day at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM Central European Time (or
    summer time) a turn will pass for
    all characters in all worlds. This will regenerate the amount
    of time your character can use.
